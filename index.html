      <hr class="divider" />
      <p>
        I have great interest in the field of software development. <br>
        Good and growing theoretical knowledge, necessary skills, and also great
        potential <br> to develop over time and become a quality software
        developer. <br>
        My motivation is my desire, my passion, which is paving my path
        before me. <br> It keeps me driven and helps me to focus my life in the
        field of software development <br> and am ready to actively develop in
        that direction throughout my life.<br> While studying at the IT
        Academy, I had the opportunity to develop my technical skills <br> needed
        to work in this profession.
        Working on different projects during my studies allowed me to learn <br>
        from mistakes and made me sure  I won't give in to errors <br> but rather
        grow a bit taller because of them.
